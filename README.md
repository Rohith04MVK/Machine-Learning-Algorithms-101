## Introduction
Welcome to our repository on Implimentations and explanations of Machine Learning Algorithms! Here, you will find a variety of resources on the different types of machine learning algorithms, as well as code implementations and explanations of how they work. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive guide to the various machine learning algorithms and their uses, helping you to understand and utilize these powerful tools in your own projects. Whether you are a beginner just starting to learn about machine learning or an experienced practitioner looking to expand your knowledge, we hope you will find something of value in our repository.

## The Task

Imagine a dataset with the data about the size of a house and its price 


| Size of house (`x`) | Price (`y`) |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| 20                  | 100         |
| 30                  | 150         |
| 40                  | 180         |

Given this data can we predict the the price for a new sized house?

| Size of house (`x`) | Price (`y`) |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| 140                 | ?           |
| 10                  | ?           |
